# CPPModules: How Excited Lovely Project!

## In general

The goal of these modules is to introduce the Object-Oriented Programming.<br>
Many languages are recommended to learn OOP.<br>
Éscole 42 decided to choose C++ since it’s derived from our old friend C.<br>
Because this is a complex language, and in order to keep things simple, the code complies with the C++98 standard.<br>
They were aware modern C++ is way different in a lot of aspects.<br>
But in order for me to become a proficient C++ developer, they decided to say: "It’s up to you to go further after the 42 Common Core!"<br>
Well, I never trust anyone now (joking(or not)).<br>
