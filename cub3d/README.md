# cub3d: make raycasting great again!

## In general

This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game,<br>
which was the first FPS ever.<br>
It has enabled me to explore ray-casting.<br>
My goal was to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you’ll have to find your way.<br>

## Usage

#### Requirements:
- MacOS/Linux
- make
- gcc
- X11 libraries (depends on which system do you use)

#### Build:
```
make
```
#### Run:
```
.cub3d [any right map]
```
i.e.
```
./cub3d map.cub
```
#### Use:
Play the game, regardless of who you are!
