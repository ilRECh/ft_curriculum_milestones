## In general

This project had to make me sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions.<br>
To succeed I had to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an optimized data sorting.<br>
Turned out that the project was a waste of my precious time.
