# ft_irc: let's chat!

## In general

This project is about creating my own IRC server with a team of 3.<br>
The main goal is to use an actual IRC client to connect to your server and test it. Of course it must work perfectly!<br>
Internet is ruled by solid standards protocols that allow connected computers to interact
with each other.<br>
So, let's learn the first messenger protocol, shall we?<br>
