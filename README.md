# ft_irc: let's chat!

## In general

This project is about creating an IRC server with a team of 3.<br>
The main goal is to use an actual IRC client to connect to the server and test it. Of course it must work perfectly!<br>
Internet is ruled by solid standards protocols that allow connected computers to interact
with each other.<br>
So, let's learn the first messenger protocol, shall we?<br>

## Usage

#### Requirements:
- MacOS/Linux
- make
- g++

#### Build:
```
make
```
#### Run:
```
./build/apps/ircserv [port] [password]
```
i.e.
```
./build/apps/ircserv 8888 1234
```
#### Use:
You must use one of the existing IRC client. For example **Adium** or **Pidgin** were used to test the IRC server.
