# ft_containers: never gonna let you build

## In general

The standard C++ containers have all a specific usage.<br>
To make sure I understand them, I've re-implemented them!<br>

## Usage

#### Requirements:
- MacOS/Linux
- make
- g++

#### Build:
```
make
```
#### Run:
```
None present, use your own tests
```
#### Use:
You must use your own tests, though I have something to advise to you.
