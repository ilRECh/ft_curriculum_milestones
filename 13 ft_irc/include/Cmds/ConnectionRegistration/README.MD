#4.1 Connection Registration

The commands described here are used to register a connection with an
IRC server as either a user or a server as well as correctly
disconnect.

A **"PASS"** command is not required for either client or server
connection to be registered, but it must precede the server message
or the latter of the **NICK/USER** combination.  It is strongly
recommended that all server connections have a password in order to
give some level of security to the actual connections.  The
recommended order for a client to register is as follows:

           1. Pass message
           2. Nick message
           3. User message
