#4.5 User based queries

User queries are a group of commands which are primarily concerned
with finding details on a particular user or group users.  When using
wildcards with any of these commands, if they match, they will only
return information on users who are 'visible' to you.  The visibility
of a user is determined as a combination of the user's mode and the
common set of channels you are both on.
