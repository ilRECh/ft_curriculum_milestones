# 4.2 Channel operations

---

This group of messages is concerned with manipulating channels, their
properties (channel modes), and their contents (typically clients).
In implementing these, a number of race conditions are inevitable
when clients at opposing ends of a network send commands which will
ultimately clash.  It is also required that servers keep a nickname
history to ensure that wherever a `<nick>` parameter is given, the
server check its history in case it has recently been changed.
