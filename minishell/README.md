# minishell: dreaming of zsh

## In general

This project is about creating a simple shell.<br>
Yes, my own little itsy bitsy bash. Cute, right? Right?<br>
I've learn a lot about processes and file descriptors.<br>
And so little about the zsh.<br>
You know what? You use **zsh** the same way you use **bash** as you use **C++** as **C with Classes**. Prove me wrong.<br>

## Usage

#### Requirements:
- MacOS/Linux
- make
- gcc

#### Build:
```
make
```
#### Run:
```
./minishell
```
#### Use:
You start my **minishell** from the actual **shell** and then you ask me how to use the **minishell**? gg then<br>
